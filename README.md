**Tagline**: *"Trusted Local Services for Borgas, Powered by Blockchain & AI"*  

---

## üéØ Overview  
BorgaTrust is a decentralized services platform tailored for Ghanaian diaspora ("borgas") seeking reliable local services (e.g., construction, education, logistics) in Ghana. It combines:  
- **Blockchain** (Solana + ICP) for trustless payments and reputation systems.  
- **AI** for personalized service recommendations.  
- **Mobile Money** integration (MTN, Vodafone) for seamless payouts.  

---

## üîç Problem Statement  
- **Borgas** struggle to verify service providers‚Äô credibility in Ghana.  
- Traditional platforms (Fiverr/Upwork) lack **low-cost cross-border payments** and **mobile money support**.  
- No integration of **decentralized identity** or **AI-driven trust systems**.  

---

## üí° Solution  
BorgaTrust solves this by:  
1. **Escrow Payments** (Solana) for secure, low-fee transactions.  
2. **Decentralized Reputation** (ICP) for immutable provider reviews.  
3. **AI Matching** (Hugging Face) to connect users with trusted providers.  
4. **Mobile Money/Payments** (Flutterwave) for universal accessibility.
